# Assignment

Work done:

Critical issues:

- When the server is restarted, the services remain (DBMigration to be launched before running the app)
- There is now the possibility to delete a service individually by clicking on the bin icon next to the URL name
- It is now possible to name the services and the date is saved when a new service is created
- The HTTP poller is now implemented

Frontend/Web track:
- There is a full create/update/delete functionality for services -> Possibility to add a new service, to update the service name and to delete a service
- The results from the poller are refresh automatically


# KRY code assignment

One of our developers built a simple service poller.
The service consists of a backend service written in Vert.x (https://vertx.io/) that keeps a list of services (defined by a URL), and periodically does a HTTP GET to each and saves the response ("OK" or "FAIL").

Unfortunately, the original developer din't finish the job, and it's now up to you to complete the thing.
Some of the issues are critical, and absolutely need to be fixed for this assignment to be considered complete.
There is also a wishlist of features in two separate tracks - if you have time left, please choose *one* of the tracks and complete as many of those issues as you can.
Feel free to use any library or framework for the frontend, or none at all.

Critical issues (required to complete the assignment):

- Whenever the server is restarted, any added services disappear
- There's no way to delete individual services
- We want to be able to name services and remember when they were added
- The HTTP poller is not implemented

Frontend/Web track:
- We want full create/update/delete functionality for services
- The results from the poller are not automatically shown to the user (you have to reload the page to see results)
- We want to have informative and nice looking animations on add/remove services

Backend track
- Simultaneous writes sometimes causes strange behavior
- Protect the poller from misbehaving services (for example answering really slowly)
- Service URL's are not validated in any way ("sdgf" is probably not a valid service)
- A user (with a different cookie/local storage) should not see the services added by another user

Spend maximum four hours working on this assignment - make sure to finish the issues you start.

Put the code in a git repo on GitHub and send us the link (niklas.holmqvist@kry.se) when you are done.

Good luck!

# Building
We recommend using IntelliJ as it's what we use day to day at the KRY office.
In intelliJ, choose
```
New -> New from existing sources -> Import project from external model -> Gradle -> select "use gradle wrapper configuration"
```

You can also run gradle directly from the command line:
```
./gradlew clean run
```
